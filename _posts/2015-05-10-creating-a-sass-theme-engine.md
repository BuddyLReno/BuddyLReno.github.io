Late last year, I was working on a project that required some elements of the page to be “theme-able” to match different live events being represented. Some background colors on containers needed to be changed and icons in certain contexts should be changeable as well. This could get out of hand quickly, as I needed to create a number of different themes. Sass is my weapon of choice, so I dug through the docs to find an efficient way to make my code work for me.
